\title{Count occurrences of linkages across multiple inferred network results from a linkage summary}
\usage{
create_activity_list(
  linkage_summary,
  cluster,
  linkage = "rec_lig",
  subject_names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{linkage_summary}{a \code{\link[=linkage_summary]{linkage_summary()}} object}

\item{cluster}{the name of the cell cluster being compared across multiple domino results}

\item{linkage}{a stored linkage type from the inferred network.}

\item{subject_names}{a vector of subject_names from the linkage_summary to be compared. If NULL, all subject_names in the linkage summary are included in counting.}
}
\value{
a list of data frames with one data frame per linkage feature. Each data frame lists whether the linkage was inferred as active (1) or inactive (0) in the surveyed subjects
}
\description{
Counts the number of subjects with active linkage for all linkage features of a linkage type
}
