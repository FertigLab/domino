\title{Summarize the proportion of subjects with active linkage}
\usage{
summarize_activity_list(activity_list, group.by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{activity_list}{list of data frames listing whether a linkage was inferred as active (1) or inactive (0) in the surveyed subjects}

\item{group.by}{the name of the column in by which to group subjects for counting. If NULL, only total counts of linkages for linkages in the cluster across all subjects is given.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns for the unique linkage features and the counts of how many times the linkage occured across the compared domino results. If group.by is used, counts of the linkages are also provided as columns named by the unique values of the group.by parameter.
}
\description{
Summarizes an activity list as a data frame where each row is an assessed linkage of the selected linkage type. If a group.by parameter is applied, the proportion of subjects in each level of the group.by variable will be returned.
}
