}
\arguments{
\item{dom}{Domino object that has undergone network building with \code{\link[=build_domino]{build_domino()}}}

\item{receptor}{Name of a receptor active in at least one cell type in the domino object}

\item{ligand_expression_threshold}{Minimum mean expression value of a ligand by a cell type for a chord to be rendered between the cell type and the receptor}

\item{cell_idents}{Vector of cell types from cluster assignments in the domino object to be included in the plot.}

\item{cell_colors}{Named vector of color names or hex codes where names correspond to the plotted cell types and the color values}
}
\value{
Renders a circos plot to the active graphics device
}
\description{
Creates a chord plot of expression of ligands that can activate a specified
receptor where chord widths correspond to mean ligand expression by the cluster.
