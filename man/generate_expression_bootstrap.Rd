\title{Generate Expression Bootstrap}
\usage{
generate_expression_bootstrap(
  counts,
  normalized_expression,
  clusters,
  TF_scores
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A matrix of RNA expression counts}

\item{normalized_expression}{A matrix of normalized RNA expression counts}

\item{clusters}{A factor of cell assignments to cell type clusters}

\item{TF_scores}{A matrix of scores representing TF activity in cells}
}
\value{
A list containing expression values for the derived bootstrap:
\itemize{
\item{'counts'} : A matrix of RNA expression counts
\item{'scaled_expression'} : A matrix of scaled normalized RNA expression counts centered on 0
\item{'clusters'} : A factor of cell assignments to cell type clusters
\item{'TF_scores'} : A matrix of scores representing TF activity in cells
}
}
\description{
Sample cell expression profiles, including transcription factor scores and cluster assignments, with replacement to generate a bootstrap for use in comparison of differential signaling between datasets without sample replicate annotation. Bootstraps will include as many cells from each cluster as the parent data set used to generate the bootstrap.
