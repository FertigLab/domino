\title{Create a vector of intercellular linkages}
\usage{
senders_as_vector(ligand_query, receiver_cell, receptor)
}
\arguments{
\item{ligand_query}{list of incoming ligands to the recipient cell type organized by their receptor}

\item{receiver_cell}{name of the receiving cluster}

\item{receptor}{name of the receptor receiving signals}
}
\value{
vector of intercellular linkages for each sender cell and active ligand
}
\description{
Rephrase an incoming ligand query into a vector of intercellular linkages in the format of:
'["receiver"]:"receptor" <- "ligand":["sender"]'
}
\examples{
example(build_domino)
LQ <- query_ligand_senders(
  dom = pbmc_dom_built_tiny,
  outgoing_list = find_outgoing_ligands(dom = pbmc_dom_built_tiny),
  receiver_cell = "CD14_monocyte"
)
senders_as_vector(
  ligand_query = LQ,
  receiver_cell = "CD14_monocyte",
  receptor = "CXCR3"
)
