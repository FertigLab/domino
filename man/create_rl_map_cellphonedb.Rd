\usage{
create_rl_map_cellphonedb(
  genes,
  proteins,
  interactions,
  complexes = NULL,
  database_name = "CellPhoneDB"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{data.frame or file path to table of gene names in uniprot, hgnc_symbol, or ensembl format in cellphonedb database format}

\item{proteins}{data.frame or file path to table of protein features in cellphonedb format}

\item{interactions}{data.frame or file path to table of protein-protein interactions in cellphonedb format}

\item{complexes}{optional: data.frame or file path to table of protein complexes in cellphonedb format}

\item{database_name}{name of the database being used, stored in output. Default is "CellPhoneDB"}
}
\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
Re-formats the CellPhoneDB data base into a single data frame where each row
describes a possible receptor-lignad interaction, the genes encoding the
partners in the interaction, whether the partner is a liand or recptor, the
name of the partner, how the interaction was annotated and the source for the
annotation, and the name of the database the rl_map was constructed from.
Ligands and receptors that function as protein complexes may be included.
Interactions involving these complexes are included as comma-seperated
character strings of genes that comprise these complexes.
