\item{group.by}{the name of the column by which to group subjects for counting.}

\item{model.formula}{model formula passed to \code{\link[=glm]{glm()}} when using test methods that accept linear models.}
}
\value{
named vector of log odds ratio, log odds ratio standard error, odds ratio, odds ratio standard error, and p-value calculated for each variable in the model by Logistic Regression result as implemented in \code{\link[=glm]{glm()}}
}
