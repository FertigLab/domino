\title{check inputs to create_domino function}
\usage{
check_create_domino(rl_map, features, ser, counts, clusters, tf_targets)
}
\arguments{
\item{rl_map}{Data frame where each row describes a receptor-ligand interaction with required columns gene_A & gene_B including the gene names for the receptor and ligand and type_A & type_B annotating if genes A and B are a ligand (L) or receptor (R)}

\item{features}{Either a path to a csv containing cell level features of interest (ie. the auc matrix from pySCENIC) or named matrix with cells as columns and features as rows.}

\item{ser}{Seurat object containing scaled RNA expression data in the RNA assay slot and cluster identity. Either a ser object OR z_scores and clusters must be provided. If ser is present z_scores and clusters will be ignored.}

\item{counts}{Counts matrix for the data. If a Seurat object is provided this will be ignored. This is only used to threshold receptors on dropout.}

\item{clusters}{Named factor containing cell cluster with names as cells. Either clusters and z_scores OR ser must be provided. If ser is present z_scores and clusters will be ignored.}

\item{tf_targets}{A list where names are transcription factors and the stored values are character vectors of genes in the transcription factor's regulon.}

\item{z_scores}{Matrix containing z-scored expression data for all cells with cells as columns and features as rows. Either z_scores and clusters must be provided OR a ser object. If ser is present z_scores and clusters will be ignored.}
