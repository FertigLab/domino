\title{Gene ortholog mapping}
\usage{
ortholog_mapping(gene, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{character. Vector of genes to be converted to gene orthologs}

\item{from}{character. Vector of genes from a reference database that contains the query genes}

\item{to}{character. Vector of gene orthologs from another reference genome to genes in from}
}
\value{
list
}
\description{
Given equal length vectors of genes from a reference genome and orthologous
genes from another genome, converts a query gene to its ortholog in the
orthologous genome. Can handle cases of one-to-many mapping, one-to-none
mapping, and many-to-one mapping. Returns a list where each value contains
a character vector containing all orthologs that map to the query gene in
the same position in the character vector query. "from" and "to" must be
equal length vectors where the reference genes share the same index in the
"from" vector as their orthologs in the "to" vector. Repeated values are
permitted in both vectors
